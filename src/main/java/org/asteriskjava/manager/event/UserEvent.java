/**
 * Abstract base class for user events.
 * <p>
 * You can send arbitrary user events via the UserEvent application provided
 * with asterisk. A user event by default has the attributes channel and
 * uniqueId but you can add custom attributes by specifying an event body.
 * <p>
 * To add your own user events you must subclass this class and name it
 * corresponding to your event. If you plan to send an event by
 * <code>UserEvent(VIPCall)</code> you will create a new class called
 * VIPCallEvent that extends UserEvent. The name of this class is important:
 * Just use the name of the event you will send (VIPCall in this example) and
 * append "Event".
 * <p>
 * To pass additional data create appropriate attributes with getter and setter
 * methods in your new class.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class VIPCallEvent extends UserEvent
 * {
 *     private String firstName;
 * 
 *     public VIPCallEvent(Object source)
 *     {
 *         super(source);
 *     }
 * 
 *     public String getFirstName()
 *     {
 *         return firstName;
 *     }
 * 
 *     public void setFirstName(String firstName)
 *     {
 *         this.firstName = firstName;
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * To send this event use <code>UserEvent(VIPCall|firstName: Jon)</code> in your
 * dialplan. Asterisk up to 1.2 (including) does only support one property in
 * the UserEvent so something like
 * <code>UserEvent(VIPCall|firstName: Jon|lastName: Doe)</code> will not work as
 * expected.
 * <p>
 * The UserEvent is implemented in <code>apps/app_userevent.c</code>.
 * <p>
 * Note that you must register your UserEvent with the ManagerConnection you are
 * using in order to be recognized.
 *
