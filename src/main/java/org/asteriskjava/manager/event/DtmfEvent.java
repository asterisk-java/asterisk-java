/**
 * A DtmfEvent is triggered each time a DTMF digit is sent or received on a
 * channel.<p>
 * To support variable-length DTMF Asterisk (since 1.4.0) interally uses two different frames
 * for DTMF releated events (<code>AST_FRAME_DTMF_BEGIN</code> and <code>AST_FRAME_DTMF_END</code>).
 * Before 1.4.0 Asterisk only used one frame (<code>AST_FRAME_DTMF</code>) which is now an alias for
 * <code>AST_FRAME_DTMF_END</code>.<br>
 * Many other systems and devices (like mobile phone providers) do not support variable-length DTMF.
 * In these cases you will only see <code>AST_FRAME_DTMF_END</code> frames in Asterisk.<br>
 * When building DTMF aware applications you should not rely on <code>AST_FRAME_DTMF_BEGIN</code>.
 * Generally it is safe to just ignore them and only react on <code>AST_FRAME_DTMF_END</code> frames.<br>
 * To check whether an DtmfEvent represents an <code>AST_FRAME_DTMF_BEGIN</code> or
 * <code>AST_FRAME_DTMF_END</code> frame use the {@link #isBegin()} and {@link #isEnd()} methods.
 * <br>
 * You can find more information on how Asterisk handles DTMF in the
 * <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+DTMF">DTMF article at voip-info.org</a><p>
 * It is implemented in <code>main/channel.c</code>.<p>
 * Available since Asterisk 1.6
