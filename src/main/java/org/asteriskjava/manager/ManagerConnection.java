 * The main interface to talk to an Asterisk server via the Asterisk Manager

 * The ManagerConnection repesents a connection to an Asterisk server and is
 * capable of sending {@link org.asteriskjava.manager.action.ManagerAction}s
 * and receiving {@link org.asteriskjava.manager.response.ManagerResponse}s and
 * {@link org.asteriskjava.manager.event.ManagerEvent}s. It does not add any
 * further functionality but rather provides a Java view to Asterisk's Manager
 * API (freeing you from TCP/IP connection and parsing stuff).
 * <p>
 * It is used as the foundation for higher leveled interfaces like the
 * Asterisk-Java Live.
 * <p>
 * A concrete implementation of this interface can be obtained from a
