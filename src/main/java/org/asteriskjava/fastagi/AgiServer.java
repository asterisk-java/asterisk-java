/**
 * Listens for incoming FastAGI connections, reads the inital data and builds an
 * {@link AgiRequest} that is then handed over to the appropriate 
 * {@link org.asteriskjava.fastagi.AgiScript} for processing.<p>
 * To pass a call from Asterisk to the AGI server add an extension to your
 * dialplan that makes use of the AGI() application. For example:
 * <pre>
 * exten =&gt; 5551212,1,AGI(agi://192.168.0.2/GetCallerRecord)
 * </pre>
 * Before Asterisk-Java returns control to the dialplan it sets the
 * channel variable <code>AJ_AGISTATUS</code> to one of the following
 * values:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>NOT_FOUND</code> if no AGI script had been configured to
 * handle the request.
 * <li><code>SUCCESS</code> if the AGI script was executed successfully. 
 * <li><code>FAILED</code> if the AGI script terminated abnormally by
 * throwing an exception or there was an internal error processing it.
 * </ul>
 * If Asterisk-Java was not able to process the request because its thread
 * pool was exhausted the <code>AJ_AGISTATUS</code> variable is not set. 
 * <p>
 * The <code>AJ_AGISTATUS</code> variable complements the <code>AGISTATUS</code>
 * variable that is set by Asterisk to <code>SUCCESS</code>, <code>FAILURE</code>
 * or <code>HANGUP</code> and is available since Asterisk 1.4.
