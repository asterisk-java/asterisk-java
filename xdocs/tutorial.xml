		<section name="The FastAGI Protocol">
			<p>The easiest way to interact with Asterisk from Java applications is via
				the FastAGI protocol. AGI scripts can handle either incoming calls or
				calls originated via the Manager API (see below for an example on how to
				use Asterisk-Java to originate a call from your Java application).</p>
			<p>The AGI (Asterisk Gateway Interface) facility allows you to launch scripts,
				from the Asterisk dial plan. Traditionally communication between the scripts
				and Asterisk was via standard input and standard output and scripts had to run
				on the same machine as Asterisk. Due to the large amount of time a Java 
				Virtual Machine needs for startup and the discomfort of having to install 
				a Java environment on the PBX box(es) Java has not been the language 
				of choice for writing AGI scripts.</p>
			<p>These drawbacks have been addressed by the addition of FastAGI to Asterisk.
				FastAGI is basically AGI over TCP/IP socket connections instead of using
				standard input and standard output as communication medium.</p>
			<p>Using FastAGI you can run a Java application (on the same machine that runs
				Asterisk or on a seperate machine) that is only started once and serves AGI
				scripts until it is shut down. Combined with Java's multithreading support
				you can build pretty fast AGI scripts using this protocol.</p>
			<p>Asterisk-Java helps you with running your Java based AGI scripts by providing
				a container that recives connections from the Asterisk server, parses the
				request and calls your scripts mapped to the called URL.</p>
			<subsection name="Hello AGI!">
				<p>To write your own AGI scripts you must implement the AGIScript interface.
					You can do so by simply extending AbstractAGIScript that provides
					some convenience methods that further simplify that task.</p>
				<p>A simple AGIScript might look as follows:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
import net.sf.asterisk.fastagi.AGIChannel;
import net.sf.asterisk.fastagi.AGIException;
import net.sf.asterisk.fastagi.AGIRequest;
import net.sf.asterisk.fastagi.AbstractAGIScript;

public class HelloAGIScript extends AbstractAGIScript
{
    public void service(AGIRequest request, AGIChannel channel)
            throws AGIException
    {
        // Answer the channel...
        answer(channel);
		
        // ...say hello...
        streamFile(channel, "welcome");
		
        // ...and hangup.
        hangup(channel);
    }
}
]]></source>
				<p>If you are using Asterisk-Java 0.2 (or a snapshot thereof)
					you should extend 
					<a href="http://asterisk-java.sourceforge.net/apidocs/net/sf/asterisk/fastagi/BaseAGIScript.html">BaseAGIScript</a>
					instead of AbstractAGIScript. That way you don't have to
					pass the channel to all the methods as this is done
					automatically.</p>
				<p>Put this Java source file into a directory of your choice,
					add the <code>asterisk-java.jar</code> and compile it:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
$ javac -cp asterisk-java.jar HelloAGIScript.java
$ 
]]></source>
				<p>Next you have to add a call to your script to your dialplan in Asterisk.</p>
				<p>You might want to add an extension 1300 to the default section of your
					<code>extensions.conf</code>:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
[default]
...
exten => 1300,1,Agi(agi://localhost/hello.agi)
]]></source>
				<p>Replace localhost with the hostname of the machine that runs Asterisk-Java.</p>
				<p>Be sure to reload Asterisk for this change to take effect. You can do so
					by executing <code>extensions reload</code> on the Asterisk CLI.</p>
				<p>Now you must map the script name <code>hello.agi</code> to the HelloAGIScript
					we just created. By default this is done in a properties file called
					<code>fastagi-mapping.properties</code> that must be on the classpath
					when we start the AGIServer. In this case it looks like:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
hello.agi = HelloAGIScript
]]></source>
				<p>Your directory should now contain the following files:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
$ ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 srt srt 163689 2005-03-11 22:07 asterisk-java.jar
-rw-r--r--  1 srt srt     26 2005-03-11 20:50 fastagi-mapping.properties
-rw-r--r--  1 srt srt    624 2005-03-11 22:07 HelloAGIScript.class
-rw-r--r--  1 srt srt    438 2005-03-11 20:50 HelloAGIScript.java
]]></source>
				<p>Finally we start the AGIServer:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
$ java -cp asterisk-java.jar:. net.sf.asterisk.fastagi.DefaultAGIServer
]]></source>
				<p>You should see some logging output indicating that the AGIServer has
					been successfully started and is listening for incoming connections:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
Mar 11, 2005 10:20:12 PM net.sf.asterisk.fastagi.DefaultAGIServer run
INFO: Thread pool started.
Mar 11, 2005 10:20:12 PM net.sf.asterisk.fastagi.DefaultAGIServer run
INFO: Listening on *:4573.
]]></source>
				<p>When you call extension 1300 you will see the AGI script being launched:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
Mar 11, 2005 10:22:47 PM net.sf.asterisk.fastagi.DefaultAGIServer run
INFO: Received connection.
Mar 11, 2005 10:22:47 PM net.sf.asterisk.fastagi.AGIConnectionHandler run
INFO: Begin AGIScript HelloAGIScript on AGIServer-TaskThread-0
Mar 11, 2005 10:22:48 PM net.sf.asterisk.fastagi.AGIConnectionHandler run
INFO: End AGIScript HelloAGIScript on AGIServer-TaskThread-0
]]></source>

			<subsection name="Extending the Example">
				<p>Have a look at the documentation of 
					<a href="apidocs/net/sf/asterisk/fastagi/AbstractAGIScript.html">AbstractAGIScript</a>
					there you will find additional methods that you can use for your own scripts.
					If you want to use commands that do not yet have a corresponding method in
					AbstractAGIScript or if you want to extend the FastAGI protocol by adding your
					own commands you can also use the 
					<a href="apidocs/net/sf/asterisk/fastagi/AGIChannel.html">channel</a>.sendCommand(<a href="apidocs/net/sf/asterisk/fastagi/command/AGICommand.html">AGICommand</a>)
					method to send arbitrary commands.</p>
				<p>You can pass parameters to your scripts by including them in the URL used with
					the AGI command. These parameters can be read by the getParameter(String) and
					getParameterValues(String) methods in
					<a href="apidocs/net/sf/asterisk/fastagi/AGIRequest.html">AGIRequest</a>.</p>
				<p>If you want to pass a parameter named user with a value of "john" to your
					script called hello.agi running on localhost your call to the AGI application
					looks like this:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
exten => 1300,1,Agi(agi://localhost/hello.agi?user=john)
]]></source>
				<p>You can also pass multiple parameters. Parameters containing special characters
					must be URL encoded.</p>
				<p>If you are about to write more complex scripts please note that your AGIScript 
					must be threadsafe. Only one instance will be used to serve all requests.
					This is kind of similar to the constraints a servlet engine places on the 
					implementation of servlets.</p>
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection name="Configuration">
				<p>You can tune the DefaultAGIServer by setting two properties: The bindPort
					and the poolSize.</p>
				<p>The bindPort determines the TCP port the server will listen on. By default
					this is the FastAGI port 4573. If you change it make sure to include the
					new port in the URLs used in <code>extensions.conf</code>. When using
					bindPort 1234 your <code>extensions.conf</code> will contain:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
exten => 1300,1,Agi(agi://localhost:1234/hello.agi)
]]></source>
				<p>To understand the poolSize property you need to know that the 
					DefaultAGIServer uses a fixed size thread pool to serve your AGIScripts.
					The poolSize determines how many threads are spawned at startup and thus
					limits the number of AGIScripts that can run at the same time. So you
					should set the poolSize to at least the number of concurrent calls the
					AGIServer should be able to handle. The default value is 10.</p>
				<p>These configuration properties can be set by providing a
					<code>fastagi.properties</code> file on the classpath.</p>
				<p>This might look like:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
bindPort = 1234
poolSize = 20
]]></source>
			</subsection>
		</section>
		<section name="The Manager API">
			<p>The Manager API is the other way for remote interaction with an Asterisk server.
				In contrast to the FastAGI protocol Asterisk does not explicitly pass control
				to your application when using the Manager API but allows you to
				query and change its state at any time.</p>
			<p>The Manager API is made up of three concepts: Actions, Responses and	Events.</p>
			<p>Actions can be sent to Asterisk and instruct it to do someting. For example your
				application can send an Action to Asterisk requesting it to dial a number and
				direct the dialed party to one of your phones. In reply to an
				Action Asterisk sends a Reply that contains the results of the operation 
				performed.</p>
			<p>Events are sent by Asterisk without a direct relation to the Actions your
				application is sending.
				Events inform you about the relevant changes in Asterisk's state. For example
				Events are used to inform your application about incoming calls or users joining
				or leaving MeetMe conference rooms.</p>
			<p>The connection to the Asterisk server via Manager API occurs over TCP/IP usually
				on the default port 5038.</p>
			<p>To enable the Manager API on Asterisk you must edit your <code>manager.conf</code>
				configuration file and restart Asterisk. The <code>manager.conf</code> also contains
				constraints on the range of IP addresses that are allowed to connect and username
				and passwords for authentication. A sample might look like:</p>
<source><![CDATA[
[general]
enabled = yes
port = 5038
bindaddr = 0.0.0.0

[manager]
secret=pa55w0rd
permit=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
read=system,call,log,verbose,agent,command,user
write=system,call,log,verbose,agent,command,user
]]></source>
			<p>This will enable the Manager AP, allow access from any IP address using the
				username "manager" and the password "pa55w0rd".</p>
			<subsection name="Hello Manager!">
				<p>Assume we have a phone connected via SIP that is available at SIP/john and
					we want to initiate a call from that phone to extension 1300 in the default
					context.</p>
				<p>We have to obtain a
					<a href="apidocs/net/sf/asterisk/manager/ManagerConnection.html">ManagerConnection</a>
					providing the hostname Asterisk is running on and the username and password
					as configured in <code>manager.conf</code>. Next we log in and send an
					<a href="apidocs/net/sf/asterisk/manager/action/OriginateAction.html">OriginateAction</a>
					and finally we disconnect.</p>
				<p>An example that does this is shown below.</p>
