ANNOUNCEMENT: Asterisk-Java 0.3-m1 released

Asterisk-Java 0.3-m1, a Java library for Asterisk PBX integration,
has been released.

The Asterisk-Java package consists of a set of Java classes that allow
you to easily build Java applications that interact with an Asterisk
PBX Server. Asterisk-Java supports both interfaces that Asterisk 
provides for this scenario: The FastAGI protocol and the Manager API.

The 0.3-m1 release candidate focuses on ease of use and provides the
new org.asteriskjava.live package that takes care of the lowlevel action
and event handling of the Manager API and offers an intuitive API for
Java developers. Asterisk-Java has been updated to take advantage of the
new features of Java 5.0 and therfore requires a Java Virtual Machine
of at least version 1.5.0.

Asterisk-Java is used in several commercial environments and by
