/**
 * The LiveChannelManager keeps a list of all of the live channels present on an
 * asterisk system. For this to work it needs to control the stream of asterisk
 * events consumed by others. This need is caused by the fact that Asterisk can
 * rename a channel many times after its comes up. When a channel is renamed
 * Asterisk sends a rename event. After the rename event all future asterisk
 * events will refer to the channel by its new name. Masquerade events pose
 * further issues in that a channel can be replaced mid way through a call. The
 * LiveChannelManager works with the ChannelProxy to manage this process. The
 * issue is that if multiple classes are accessing the LiveChannelManager and
 * those classes are consuming asterisk events form their own direct source then
 * they may be behind or ahead of the LiveChannelManager in processing events.
 * The result is that when attempting to access a channel by name from the
 * LiveChannelManager the channel name may not match as the LiveChannelManager
 * may have processed a rename event whilst the consumer may still be processing
 * older events which are still referring to the channel via its old name. The
 * first part of the solution is to wrap the asterisk-java events with our own
 * events which pass an iChannel interface rather than a raw channel name.
 * Because the iChannel interface is a handle to a channel managed via the
 * LiveChannelManager then the name will be updated during the rename. To ensure
 * that events are processed in an orderly fashion you MUST only obtain an event
 * listener via AsteriskPBX.addListener(); The second part of the solution is
 * the ChannelProxy. The ChannelProxy handles masquerading of channels where in
 * a live channel is replaced with a new channel part way through a call. This
 * can happen when transfering a call, parking a call or other similar actions.
 * The ChannelProxy implements the iChannel interface and is affectively hidden
 * from consumers of iChannels. The LiveChannelManager uses the proxy to replace
 * a live channel during a masqurade event. A consumer holding an iChannel
 * handle will not even be aware (and does not need to be) that the underlying
 * channel has been replaced.
