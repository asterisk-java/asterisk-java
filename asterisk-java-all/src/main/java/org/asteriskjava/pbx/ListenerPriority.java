     * running in its own thread. This means that they are passed without delay.
     * You must also ensure that you don't delay the processing of these
     * messages as there may be real time event listeners. If you are concerned
     * that you are going to delay the processing then you need to add in your

     * tardiness. NOTE: you cannot rely on the LiveChannelManager as it
     * processes events from the standard event queue. This means that Rename
     * and Masquerade events MAY (very likely) not have been process when the
     * realtime listener recieves an event.
