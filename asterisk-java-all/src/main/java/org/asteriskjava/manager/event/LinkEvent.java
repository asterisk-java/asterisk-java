 * A LinkEvent is triggered when two voice channels are linked together and voice data exchange

 * Several Link events may be seen for a single call. This can occur when Asterisk fails to setup a
 * native bridge for the call.This is when Asterisk must sit between two telephones and perform
 * CODEC conversion on their behalf.<p>
 * It is implemented in <code>channel.c</code>
