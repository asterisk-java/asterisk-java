Building with Maven

  Retrieve the latest version of Asterisk-Java from github:

---
git clone https://github.com/srt/asterisk-java.git
---
  
  Then change to the created asterisk-java directory and use Maven 3 to
  build the project
  
---
cd asterisk-java
mvn install
---

  This will create the asterisk-java-${VERSION}.jar in the target subdirectory
  as well as in your local maven repository.
