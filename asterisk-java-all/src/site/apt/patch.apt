How To Create and Submit a Patch

  This documents how to create and submit patches for Asterisk-Java.

* Introduction

  A patch is exactly what the word says: a small piece of code used to 
  repair a breach. It is normally a plain text file containing only 
  the differences between the current version of the code and the 
  fixed version.
  
  Often patches are also used to submit enhancements.

* Generating a Patch
  
  The preferred way of creating a patch is to create it against latest 
  development branch. This ensures that the patch works with the latest
  version of the source code and makes it easier to apply the patch.
  
  To generate the patch you need to check out a copy of the source code 
  from SVN. Look a the {{{cvs-usage.html}CVS Howto}} for
  the details.
  
  After you have made the changes to the source code and 
  made sure it compiles and works as expected, you can create the 
  patch file using the command 
  
+-----------------------------------------+
svn diff > /path/to/patchfile.patch
+-----------------------------------------+
  
  If you do not have access to SVN you can generate the patch against 
  the latest release.
  
  To generate the patch you will need two copies of the source code:
  one that is unmodified and one containing your changes to the source.
  Start by downloading the source code of the latest release, extract 
  it and make a copy of the entire source directory. After you have 
  made your changes to one of the source directories and made sure it 
  compiles and works as expected, you can create the patch file using 
  the command 
  
+-----------------------------------------+
diff -ru /path/to/unmodified/source /path/to/modified/source > /path/to/patchfile.patch
+-----------------------------------------+

* Sending a Patch

  The preferred way to submit a patch is via the
  {{{http://jira.reucon.com/browse/AJ}Bug Tracker}}.
  
  The patch can be reviewed there in public and other suggestions
  can be discussed.
